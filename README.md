What is this: Personal Selenium project to further my understanding of both Selenium and Python.<br>
If you are reading this,  I hope that my code gives clear examples on ways to implement or <br>
improve Selenium in Python into your own projects. If you have any suggestions or need help, <br>
please feel free to reach out at MixonRobertH@gmail.com  <br>
 <br>
Goal: Better understand selenium, selenium tools and python utilizing the pycharm IDE.  <br>
 <br>
Steps to get started and run test for windows:<br>
 <br>
Install Python from || https://www.python.org/<br>
Install PyCharm IDE || https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/<br>
Clone this repository over to your PycharmProjects or another local folder<br>
You will need to create a venv or virtual environment file for this project.<br>
Open project in pycharm and start a terminal.<br>
In terminal, run || pip install selenium & pip install webdriver_manager <br>
 <br>
pytest branch uses pytest and pagefactory. you can run a pip for both of these tools. <br>
